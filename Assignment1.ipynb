        "  - Python has a simple syntax similar to English.\n",
        "  - Python code is executed line-by-line,which makes debugging easier.\n",
        "  - No need to declare variable types.\n",
        "  - Python has a rich set of libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib.\n",
        "  - Python is free and supported by a large community.\n",
        "  - Python code can run on different platforms wihout modification.\n",
        "  - Supports classes and objects.\n",

        "\n",
        " - Predefined keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python and cannot be used as identifiers.\n",
        " - Examples: if, else, elif, while, for, def, return, True, False, class, import\n",
